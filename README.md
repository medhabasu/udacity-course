# Analyse US bikeshare data
This project lets users analyse travel patterns based on bikeshare data in three US cities - Washington, New York and Chicago. It presents analysis on travel times, popular stations, frequent trips and user profiles for a selected city.

### Date created
This project was created in July 2023.

### Description
This project takes user input on which city, month and day they would like to explore data for. It lets users view the raw data as well as analysis on the following areas:

* Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
* Popular stations and trip
* Trip duration
* User info

### Data used
It uses randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 for all three cities. All three cities have data on these six areas:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year
